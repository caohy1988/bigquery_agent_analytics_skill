"""Bootstrap Google Cloud prerequisites for BQAA tracing.

The script is intentionally dry-run by default. Pass --execute when the printed
plan looks right. It uses the caller's current Google Cloud credentials for
setup, and grants narrower runtime roles to --principal when provided.

--writer-role row-writer grants the writer only what inserting rows takes: a
custom role with bigquery.tables.updateData and bigquery.tables.get, on the
events table alone, so the writer reads no rows, runs no queries and deletes
nothing. --token-creator lets a group impersonate the writer service account,
and --reader gives a group the views (in the views dataset), with the views
authorized on the events dataset so readers need no access to the table.
Before it grants anything, it refuses a writer that already holds other
grants on the project, the datasets or the table (--allow-existing-grants
keeps them), and a bqaaRowWriter role that holds more than those two
permissions; --token-creator is taken only with --writer-role row-writer.
It also takes the project's Viewer and Editor groups off the events dataset
(and Editors off the views dataset), so those project roles read no rows
(--keep-project-groups leaves them), lists who still reads every row through
a project role (custom ones too, by their permissions), and stops if a
--reader or --token-creator member does (--allow-existing-grants keeps it),
or may: through a domain, or a group whose membership Cloud Identity does not
answer for (--accept-unverified accepts that, and only that).
